# Sorting_Visualizer webapp

A web application that helps to understand how the sorting algorithms are working by visual representation of it.

Available algorithms:
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort

Features of the application:
1. Colored representation of the steps being executed.
  1.1) Blue: default.

  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved.
  1.4) Green: In correct position.
2. 3 Controls for visualizations for the user.
  2.1) Speed of visualization option (5 levels).
  2.2) Data size selection option(10 - 120).
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4. Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized(Best case, Average Case and Worst case).
